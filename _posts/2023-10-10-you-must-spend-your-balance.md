How to spend all balance?

It's easy!

If you have 0.29, 0.39, 0.49, 0.59, 0.69, 0.79, 0.89, 0.95, 0.99 or 1 USD, you could buy a item equal the balance, because App Store allow these price.

Which App have some many prices? this one: https://apps.apple.com/us/app/trim-video/id6444441547

If you have other number, such 0.5 USD, you can't find any item equal the balance, because App Store don't allow these price. In fact, there is a way:

1. Recharge another 10 USD, you will get 10.5
2. spend 1 USD, you will get 9.5
3. spend 0.95 USD 10 times, you will get 0
